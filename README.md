# Speed-Dating
Visualisation, unsupervised and supervised learning of Speed Dating Dataset

The aim of this report is to analyse how accurately participants in speed dating events can predict what attributes they will look for in the opposite gender. Furthermore, these desired attributes are compared with the actual attributes which participants assigned to their matches and non-matches.  
Section 2 contains a description of the dataset used in this study. Afterwards, an identification of key challenges to be addressed is explained in Section 3. Further exploration with the help of visualisation analysis is introduced in Section 4 and upon obtaining a better understanding of the variables, agglomerative clustering methods is presented in Section 5 followed by decision tree classifiers in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 contains a detailed reflection on the methods used and Section 8 concludes the report.
